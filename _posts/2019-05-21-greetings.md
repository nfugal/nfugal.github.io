It is time. I've decided to start keeping a record of the stuff I do. Mostly for me, but considering how often similar records from other people have helped me out I figured I'd share itâ€”you know, because reciprocity and such. Plus this way I get to have some influence on my general internet presence in a way that is fully under my control. I like that.

So here it is. My site/blog/landingpage.
