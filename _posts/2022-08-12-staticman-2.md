## Let the Commenting Commence‚ÄïFor Realzies This Time

Well I got comments working via [Staticman](https://staticman.net/), so that's nice. üçª But I had a rather difficult time getting it to work and I'm not _completely_ satisfied with this implementation. ü´† A few things still niggle my brain and occupy my ToDo list, including but necessarily limited to:
1. I couldn't get it to work with my site being published on CloudflarePages. 
  + For me, it has only worked while published on GitHub Pages. Seems like it might have something to do with the `JEKYLL_ENV=production` option, but that is speculation and inadmissible to the court. Here's the [comment on GitHub](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/2031#issuecomment-455327104) which is the basis for my speculation.
  + When I tried to get it working while published on CloudflarePages, _after_ I had it running happily on GitHub Pages so I _knew_ it was working, I could get it to partially work (comment form showing up) but when I corrected the repo in `_config.yml` it broke in strange new ways. The theme stopped working and all the links broke, including the links for any posts. I sure haven't been able to make sense of that.
2. I would like to get threaded comments working.
4. No Mailgun or reCaptcha for now. Hopefullly that portion of the config is simple now that I have the basic funtionality in place ü§û
4. I would like to tweak the comment form but things feel a bit precarious still so I'm reluctant to try. I guess that is what branches are for? ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø


Some notes for fellow travelers that find themselves following a similar path (this includes Future-Nate):

+ Staticman v3 **works** with [MinimalMistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/) but the config was _not_ intuitive to me and the [documentation](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/#staticman-v3) felt a little unclear. ü§è Probably the documentation would have been fine if I'd been deploying on GitHub Pages or GitLab Pages but since I was using CloudflarePages all of my troubleshooting was maddening and made me question every speck of documentation I could find. üßê
  + For the comment provider, one still sets it to `staticman_v2` in one's `_config.yml`. ‚úÖ
  + However, for the endpoint one uses the `v3` style url. ‚úÖ
  + I put the snippet from my config that works with Staticman v3 at the end of this post because a multi-line code block kept breaking my list or the indentation in the snippet. If anyone knows how to do a multi-line code block as a list item in MarkDown such that the indentation in said snippet gets preserved, let me know, you can even just use the comment form now üòú
  + For the `staticman.yml` file I included `githubAuth.clientId` & `githubAuth.clientSecret` with a `secret` for each encrypted via Staticman as documented [here](https://staticman.net/docs/encryption). ‚úÖ
  + My Staticman instance is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) leveraging a [personal fork](https://github.com/nfugal/staticman) of the [official Staticman repo](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman) and a [private GitHub app](https://staticman.net/docs/getting-started.html) installed in [my site's repo](https://github.com/nfugal/nfugal.github.io).
    + My Staticman instance on Heroku spins down when idle with log messages like the following, which were concerning until I read closer and saw the bit about `Idling` üîç 
    
    ```console
    2022-08-13T04:34:01.650009+00:00 heroku[web.1]: Idling
    2022-08-13T04:34:01.652984+00:00 heroku[web.1]: State changed from up to down
    2022-08-13T04:34:04.163849+00:00 heroku[web.1]: Stopping all processes with SIGTERM
    2022-08-13T04:34:04.239238+00:00 app[web.1]: Error waiting for process to terminate: No child processes
    2022-08-13T04:34:04.397821+00:00 heroku[web.1]: Process exited with status 22
    ```

This is probably where I'll leave things for a while. I'm glad to have things (mostly) working how I'd like.

But first, the code snippet as promised:

```yaml
repository: "nfugal/nfugal.github.io" # GitHub username/repo-name e.g. "mmistakes/minimal-mistakes"
comments:
  provider: "staticman_v2"
  staticman:
    branch: "main"
    endpoint: https://staticman.<herokuinstance>/v3/entry/github/
``` 

<br />

_Remember, if something hasn't gone wrong yet, you're not trying hard enough._
