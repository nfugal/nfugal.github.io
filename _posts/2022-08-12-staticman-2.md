## Let the Commenting Commence―For Realzies This Time

Well I got comments working via [Staticman](https://staticman.net/), so that's nice. But I had a rather difficult time getting it to work and I'm not completely satisfied with this implementation. A few things still niggle my brain and occupy my ToDo list:
1. I couldn't get it to work with my site being published on CloudflarePages. For me, it has only worked while published on GitHub Pages. Seems like it might have something to do with the `JEKYLL_ENV=production` option, but that is speculation and inadmissible to the court. Here's the [comment on GitHub](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/2031#issuecomment-455327104) which is the basis for my speculation. 
2. I would like to get threaded comments working.
4. No Mailgun or reCaptcha for now. Hopefullly that portion of the config is simple now that I have the basic funtionality in place 🤞
4. I would like to tweak the comment form but things feel a bit precarious still so I'm reluctant to try. I guess that is what branches are for?


Some notes for any fellow travelers that are following the same path:

+ Staticman v3 _works_ with [MinimalMistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/) but the config was not intuitive to me and the [documentation](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/#staticman-v3) felt a little unclear. Probably the documentation would have been fine if I'd been deploying on GitHub Pages or GitLab Pages but since I was using CloudflarePages all of my troubleshooting was maddening and made me question every speck of documentation I could find.
  + For the comment provider, one still sets it to `staticman_v2` in one's `_config.yml`.
  + However, for the endpoint one uses the v3 style url.
  + I put the snippet from my config that works with Staticman v3 at the end of this post because a multi-line code block kept breaking my list or the indentation in the snippet. If anyone knows how to do a multi-line code block as a list item in MarkDown such that the indentation in said snippet get preserved, let me know, you can even just use the comment form now 😜
  + For the `staticman.yml` file I included `githubAuth.clientId` & `githubAuth.clientSecret` with a `secret` for each encrypted via Staticman as documented [here](https://staticman.net/docs/encryption).
  + My Staticman instance is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) leveraging a [personal fork](https://github.com/nfugal/staticman) of the [official Staticman repo](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman) and a [private GitHub app](https://staticman.net/docs/getting-started.html) installed in [my site's repo](https://github.com/nfugal/nfugal.github.io).
    + My Staticman instance spins down when idle with messages like the following, which were concerning until I read closer and saw the bit about `Idling`:
    
    ```no-highlight
    2022-08-13T04:34:01.650009+00:00 heroku[web.1]: Idling
    2022-08-13T04:34:01.652984+00:00 heroku[web.1]: State changed from up to down
    2022-08-13T04:34:04.163849+00:00 heroku[web.1]: Stopping all processes with SIGTERM
    2022-08-13T04:34:04.239238+00:00 app[web.1]: Error waiting for process to terminate: No child processes
    2022-08-13T04:34:04.397821+00:00 heroku[web.1]: Process exited with status 22
    ```

This is probably where I'll leave things for a while. I'm glad to have things (mostly) working how I'd like.

Code snippet as promised:

```yaml
repository: "nfugal/nfugal.github.io" # GitHub username/repo-name e.g. "mmistakes/minimal-mistakes"
comments:
  provider: "staticman_v2"
  staticman:
    branch: "main"
    endpoint: https://staticman.natefugal.tech/v3/entry/github/
```
