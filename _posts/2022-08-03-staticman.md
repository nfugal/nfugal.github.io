## Let the Commenting Commence

I [promised long ago]({% post_url 2019-05-22-strange-planet %}) that comments were on the to do list. Today I'm trying to make them work.

I took a look at [Staticman](https://staticman.net/) a [long time ago](https://github.com/nfugal/staticman-tutorial), but didn't ever end up connecting it to anything. I briefly tried [giscus](https://giscus.app/) as well, but figured Staticman had at least earned another stab.
