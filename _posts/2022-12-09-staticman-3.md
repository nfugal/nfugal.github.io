## Let the Commenting Pause... Again

Remember how I had [comments working]({% post_url 2022-08-12-staticman-2 %}) happily? Well Heroku discontinued their free plans so I am in the process of moving things to [Cyclic](https://www.cyclic.sh/). I think I _almost_ have it working but in the meantime, comments are broken again. Sigh. Try to contain your greif. 

I'll post again once I have them back in working order.
