## Time for a Change

There have been some events recently that have resulted in me deciding to change from using [pfSense](https://www.pfsense.org/) as my home firewall to [OPNsense](https://opnsense.org/).

At the recommendation of a trusted friend I started using pfSense several years ago (2016, IIRC). I've been mostly pleased with pfSense, but I'm excited to try something new.

As an incurable tinkerer, the prospect of learning and setting up a new tool is usually something I look forward to.

While OPNsense & pfSense [share some DNA](https://docs.opnsense.org/history/thefork.html), they are pretty different now.

So onward and upward, new horizons, et cetera, et cetera.

I hope to do some sort of write up about the new setup in the near future (hopefully new hardware soon too).
