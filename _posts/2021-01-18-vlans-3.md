I decided to stop fighting cross-vendor-VLAN-interoperability and traded out my Brocade switch for a Cisco model with POE. Now all the things plug into a single switch so I don't have to worry about 802.1q implementations being consistent. Plus I've got loads more experience with Cisco than Brocade so I feel much more at home configuring/figuring it out.

I ended up going with a secondhand [Cisco WS-C3750E-48PD-SF](https://router-switch.com/pdf/ws-c3750e-48pd-sf-datasheet.pdf). Thanks [Tams](https://usedserversoutlet.com/index.php)! In addition to simplifying my setup, it had the unintentional (and very welcome) side effect of making my rack a few degrees cooler and consequently much quieter.

I feel a little disappointed to not have slain the beastâ€•but I have a solution, so not too disappointed.

I'll do another post on my updated setup sometime soon-ish... maybe. Given my current release pace, you probably shouldn't hold your breath.
