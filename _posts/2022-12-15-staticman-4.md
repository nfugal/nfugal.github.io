## Let the Commenting Re-Commence!

Whelp, I didn't manage to get Staticman working on Cyclic. However, I _did_ get Staticman working as a self-hosted thing. So I'll take it!

Other apps that I self-host have proved to have sufficient stability and availability for me, so it seems reasonable to expect Staticman to do the same.
