I know that it has been a while since I posted anything. I'm pretty sure that I don't have enough of a following for my absence to have mattered though. If I am wrong, let me know. I'll be very & pleasantly surprised.

Even though it has been a while this is just a short post. A quick update on my battle with VLANs.

I recently changed my home network some. With the help of a good friend I reorganized my rack and implemented some basic cable management (thanks again friend, you know who you are).

As part of the physical rearranging I changed the logical layout some to. My network is no longer flat! I made some progress with VLANs!

I haven't fully got them where I like just yet, but I'm getting there. I setup guest Wi-Fi on an isolated VLAN. I plan to implement further division sometime in the future.

I'm pleased to have them working at all. Hopefully I'll make more progress soon.

That's all for now.
