## Does This New-Fangled Thing Work?

The 1st Gatsy-based version of my website supported the [WebP](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/) image format. The 2nd Gatsby version, did not. Now I'm just testing out if this Jekyll version does.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/crow.webp" alt="A .webp Image of a Crow" caption="A .webp Image of a Crow" %}

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/unconverted/crow.jpg" alt="A .jpg Image of a Crow" caption="A .jpg Image of a Crow" %}
