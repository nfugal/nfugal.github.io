## Sometimes life kicks you in the gut. I believe in getting back up.

I read a post about this idea and poem on [The Art of Manliness](https://www.artofmanliness.com) a while back. I also read about establishing a personal code and/or creedo.

#### “Invictus” by William Ernest Henley

>_Out of the night that covers me, <br />
Black as the Pit from pole to pole, <br />
I thank whatever gods may be <br />
For my unconquerable soul. <br />
<br />
In the fell clutch of circumstance <br />
I have not winced nor cried aloud. <br />
Under the bludgeonings of chance <br />
My head is bloody, but unbowed. <br />
<br />
Beyond this place of wrath and tears <br />
Looms but the horror of the shade, <br />
And yet the menace of the years <br />
Finds, and shall find me, unafraid. <br />
<br />
It matters not how strait the gate, <br />
How charged with punishments the scroll, <br />
I am the master of my fate; <br />
I am the captain of my soul. <br />_

_Invictus_ embodies something that I believe in. I believe in getting back up. There it is. For whatever it is worth.
