## Can It Be Done?

"Even trying it is mad!" you say? Well that didn't stop me. I recently set about helping someone who is less-comfortable with tech than I am convert their portfolio site from [Adobe Portfolio](https://portfolio.adobe.com/) to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) template. It was their first time using `git` at all. Nearly their first time using a CLI  to do anything (my terminal emulator of preference is  [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/). It is delightful). It went surprisingly well. They expressed a desire for more customization than was possible with Adobe Portfolio, but didn't want to pay for hosting elsewhere―which is where GitHub Pages comes in. I decided to recommend Jekyll because I use it enough to feel mostly comfortable with it.

There were some bumps in the road to be sure. One of which is the age of the Macbook being used. Because of the age, the various Adobe programs had stopped working. This lead to using [OpenCore Legacy Patcher](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/releases/tag/0.6.0) to install a newer version of MacOS than officially supported by Apple. This solved the issue with Adobe programs, but is not without its own drawbacks. It turns out that OpenCore works better if you follow _all_ the instructions―which I didn't do initially. Once that was squared away the aged Macbook started behaving much better.

The website is still a work in progress, but it is up on GitHub Pages and the user knows how to change things and publish the changes. Now all that is left is for them to finish tweaking it to their liking and then do the cutover to the custom domain they have.
