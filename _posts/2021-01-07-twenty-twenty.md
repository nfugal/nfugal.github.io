Hey there. It's been a minute. A really loooooong minute.

So you might have noticed, 2020 was a pretty... unusual year.

Well, it was pretty unusual for me too.

For one thing, I changed back to having short hair in Jan 2020. It pretty much all went downhill from there ;)

The short version is, it started to fall out lots. I didn't go bald, but the falling out was easier to deal with with shorter individual hairs. So the return of Short Hair Nate happened.

I don't feel like it would be productive, helpful for me, or meaningful to nameless internet strangers to rehash all the things that happened in 2020, but I wanted to at least mark its passing. Me & mine survived, relatively untouched by all the craziness. I'm still here. You're still here (if you're not still here, but you're somehow reading this, drop me a line. I have many questions for you). So here's to new things! Hopefully better ones!
