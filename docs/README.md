### The code behind NateFugal.tech

This is the repo for deploying my personal website/blog/landing-page, hosted on CloudFlare Pages. It is the 4th-ish iteration of said website.

I can't imagine it being much use to someone else, but if any of the bits here help you, you are most certainly welcome to them.

This probably would _not_ be a particularly exciting repo to watch/follow.

Built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme.

-Cheers!
