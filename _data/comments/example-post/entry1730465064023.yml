message: "Today, I went to the beachfront with my children. I found \r\na sea shell and gave it to my 4 year old daughter and said \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She put \r\nthe shell to her ear and screamed. There was a hermit crab inside and \r\nit pinched her ear. She never wants to go back! LoL I know this is entirely \r\noff topic but I had to tell someone!"
